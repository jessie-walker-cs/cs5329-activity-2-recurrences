# Activity 2.1 – Recurrence Experimentation and Analysis
**Course:** CS 5329 – Algorithm Design and Analysis  
**Student Name:** Jessie Walker 
**Semester:** Spring 2026

## Overview
This assignment compares a naive recursive Fibonacci implementation with a dynamic programming
implementation (memoization) to observe differences in runtime behavior as input size grows.

## How to Run the Code
From the repository directory, run:

```bash
python assignment2_fibonacci.py
